Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

I did not actually change too much, I tried to keep everything formatted properly as before. I lined up everything a lot better and over all it looks a bit cleaner. The website is also black. The new technology hindered development slightly until I picked and warmed back up to the technology. Afterwards, it felt a lot better after I figured out how Express and Vite worked together.
