## Link: https://a4-aarogyarijal-a25.onrender.com

A simple mileage tracker application converted from vanilla JavaScript to React, maintaining the exact same functionality with GitHub OAuth authentication.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Bootstrap CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: GitHub OAuth with Passport.js

### What Changed
- Converted `public/index.html` + `public/login.html` + `public/main.js` into a Single `App.tsx` React component
- Same exact UI using Bootstrap classes
- Same exact functionality: add, edit, delete mileage records
- Same GitHub OAuth login flow
- Same API endpoints and data structure

### Did the New Technology Improve or Hinder Development Experience?

Converting existing vanilla JS to React was more tedious than expected. Would've been way easier to just start from scratch with React. That said, the final result is cleaner and TypeScript did catch a few bugs. But honestly, the conversion process was more work than the benefits were worth, in the short term at least.
