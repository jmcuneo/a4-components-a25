i ended up doing assignment 2 instead because assignment 3 was being weird. im using usestates and useeffects and using jsx to render html
elements. This tech ended up really hindering the dev process because it is just so buggy and for something simple like this it gets real
annoying. I could see how this could work on a bigger project, maybe across multiple sites or something.
