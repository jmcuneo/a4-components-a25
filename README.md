Made it so the entire table has full functionality with react. The problems I had were getting auth0 to work with react, so I ended up making it so you don't need to login.
I will fix this functionality for next assignment, as for this assignment the login functionality did not need to function with react. Currently,
Adding anything to the table bricks it because nobody is "signed in" so that will be fixed when the login starts to work with react.
I think react is in general a better way to format things, and it seems cleaner, but the transition is hard. I would've rather started on react
and built this from the ground up. ALSO NOTE: mongodb is not allowing render to work as it needs a cloud service which costs money. Run this on a personal machine to get it to work
