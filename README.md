## To-Do List

https://a4-conormccoy.onrender.com/

This project is a to-do list web application that allows users to add, delete, and update tasks. The tasks persist within a single browser session.

For this assignment, I converted the original JavaScript, HTML, and CSS project into a React application. This involved refactoring the DOM logic into a component-based structure using JSX and managing the application's data through React's state and props. The task list is now rendered dynamically from a state array, and all event handling for adding, deleting, and updating tasks is handled within the React component.

Using a new technology like React significantly improved the development experience. Managing the application's state was much cleaner than constantly querying the DOM to read or change data. React's eliminated the complex and process of manually creating, updating, and removing DOM elements. Overall, it made the code more organized, predictable, and easier to debug.
