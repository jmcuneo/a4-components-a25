## Library

your hosting link : I cannot for the life of me get this to work on render right now

So heres what you can do. Run "node server.js", then run 'npm run dev' and check out localhost:5173 because it will be there I promise.

I was not able to get render to work. I wasn't able to make it recognize vite as being there. I suppose a lot of the dependencies confused me and made it much more difficult.
I enjoyed being able to put html into the javascript with jsx files. While I dont have a massive code base that would see the most benefit, being able to not have to build everything again after one small change is good.
There were so many interlocking parts that I just couldnt get to work in the end. I am sad this is the case but I recognize that it is so.
