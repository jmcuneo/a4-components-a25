## The Best Todo App

I didn't change much to the ui, the layout of form task input is very similar, with the only differece being that the task description now a textarea, allowing for text wrapping for a longer description. The new technology, particulary the ability to define small functions within a component that interact with the data was convinent in my opinion, improving my devlopment speed becuase I didn't have to switch between files and the workflow just made sense. I've use React before, so I was familar with how components and state work.
