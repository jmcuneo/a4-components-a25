## BMI Simulator: https://a4-kensebastian.onrender.com/
Allows users to input their height and weight, and automatically calculates their BMI, and whether it's at a healthy level.

This was a copy of my a2 assignment, but I implemented the grid using a React AG-Grid component

The technology was tough to adapt to at first, since my entire project was set up without Vite and React. I spent hours trying to convert it, then just decided to start from scratch with a new Vite + React Project, then redid most of the functionality from A2.
I would say that using React components is more intuitive than what I had originally done for A2, so it improved the developer experience.
