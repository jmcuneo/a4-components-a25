# Game Hub

Host Link: a4-tiennguyen.vercel.app

This project is for hosting whatever game my team has right now and in the future

## Idea:
I do this project totally from scratch using React and Style Component. I want to create a web to host all games for my team's final project. In the game section, users can click on the game they like and it will lead them to a new tab with that game. Currently, I have plugged in some game and leave other with a placement image.

## Design:
- I only use 4 color for my page black, white, light pink and gray-ish.
- I generated thumbnail images and my teammate avatar image with AI.


For me, the new technology really improve the coding experience and make everything more fun. For example, style-component in React let me code mixing html and javascript at once.
