Assignment 4 - Components - Cameron Norris

## Movie Log (With React)

For A4, I used React to modify my A3!
I did not change much at all from A3, I simply refactored all of my code and files to run with React. This meant breaking down each of the components of the site into jsx files and linking them all together, keeping in mind the flow of the site.
In the beginning, the learning curve took a while to overcome. I did not realize the general structure of how jsx files should be organized, but once everything clicked, the refactoring process was quick. I did, however, have to change the way I navigated from page to page (now in App) and the new solution is overall a lot cleaner and more effective than before.
Overall, React helped me create a more organize file system and site.
