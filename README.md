Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

This project allows users to RSVP and add themselves to a guestlist for events. In addition to assignment 3, I used React for my components/UI and separated my server from my client code. I would say the new technology certainly caused unforseen errors in the setup and initial development of the project. However, long term, React will be extremely helpful for expanding this project. The code written is easily reusable, so in future development, I will not need to write as much manually. The way I see it is that React/new technologies take more time and effort to complete and correct the setup, but they can greatly increase productivity and potential of web applications
