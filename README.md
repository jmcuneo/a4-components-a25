## Calorie Tracker

https://a4-matthew-franco-a25.onrender.com/

This project is a Calorie Tracker web application that allows users to log meals, calories, and filter entries by date. For assignment #4, the app was refactored to use TypeScript for both the Express backend and React frontend, and the frontend was split into modular components. A date picker was added to filter meals, and the build process was updated to deploy both backend and frontend together on Render. Using TypeScript and Vite improved the development experience by providing better type safety, faster builds, and easier component management, though initial configuration required some troubleshooting. Overall, the new technology streamlined development and deployment.

### Use of AI

AI tools, specifically GitHub Copilot, were used throughout this assignment to assist with refactoring and troubleshooting. Copilot provided suggestions for TypeScript conversion, React component structure, and Express server configuration. It also helped resolve build and deployment issues, and offered guidance on best practices for integrating backend and frontend code.
