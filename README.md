## Car Tracker with React!

https://a4-josephabata.onrender.com

This app is a car tracker that lets you keep a list of your cars online. You can create an account by just picking a username and password, then start adding cars to your collection.

For each car, you enter the model, year, miles per gallon, and what type of fuel it uses. You can also check off features like sunroof or leather seats. The app automatically calculates how old each car is based on its year.

Once you add cars, you can see them all in a table and edit or delete them if you need to. There's also a statistics section that shows your total number of cars and averages for MPG and age.

Everything saves to your account so you can come back later and your car list will still be there. It works in a web browser and you can use it on your phone or computer.
