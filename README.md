## Watchlistify

Render: https://a4-christinengo.onrender.com

A watchlist site that allows users to keep track of all the shows and movies they've watched or are currently watching.
It logs the format, title, genre, rating, episodes watched, total episodes, and progress. Each user can access their own data by logging into their GitHub account.

I used Vite and React to make components for the header, form, table, and footer. It uses App.jsx and main.jsx so the html code is no longer in index.html and login.html. I also used states for the form and data. 

The new technology hindered my development experience a bit since I had to remember the different syntax used for React. I also had to change all the require statements into imports to get everything working properly. 
The ability to modify entries in the table uses contentEditable on the cells, so I had to make some adjustments to that as well.
