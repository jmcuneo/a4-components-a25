 ## Vinyl Collection

https://a4-maxwelljeronimo-a25.onrender.com

I reimplemented my Assingment 2 project using React with Vite.  Users are able to add, edit, and delete vinyls, mark whether they are owned or not, and tag links to them if they are not owned.  Using React made it so state and rendering are now fully automated, rather than using DOM to manually update unlikey Assignment 2.  It also made organization much easier, though setting up the server was a bit more challenging with Vite.
