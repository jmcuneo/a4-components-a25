## Movie Reviewer

https://a4-tiffanysemexant-a25.onrender.com 

I reimplemented my A2 project using svelte. I optimized some of the code I used previously for A2 on this one, and used
my server code from A3 since it used express. But other than that, it has the same functionality. The user enters in
their reviews of movies, and the site stores and displays the information. I think that in some ways the new technology
hindered the development, and in some ways it improved it. At first, I found the learning curve of svelte to be quite
difficult. Even though I went through the whole tutorial on their site, which was a great help, I often had trouble 
why things went wrong and how to fix them. But once I sortof got the hang of it, I found that I was better able to optimize my code because of svelte's reactivity.
