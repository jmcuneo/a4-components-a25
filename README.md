Assignment 4 - Components
===
Render link: https://a4-hrithikaravishankar-components-1.onrender.com

This project is a reimplementation of my Assignment 2 (Grocery List app) using React. Users can add, edit, and delete grocery items. Each item includes a category and expiration date, and the app calculates the number of days left until expiration. The front end is built with React components and communicates with an Express server.

Challenges: 
- setup issues:
    * Had trouble with the initial npm setup due to npx create-vite-express creating a nested folder structure? had to get start over setup a couple of times
Note:
- Finally got my edit function to work after attempting it in assignment 2

Resources Used:
- https://react.dev/ --> had to research JSX syntax, especially useState, useEffect
- https://vite.dev/ along with professor's resources --> for setting up the project and running the development server

Reflection:
The biggest change was learning how to manage the form and the list using React components and state. At first it was a little confusing switching from the way I structured things in A2, since I had to get used to how React organizes data and updates. Once I got past that, it actually made the app feel much more organized and easier to edit. Compared to A2, I feel like React gave me more control over the different parts of the app, especially when adding and editing items. Overall, it was a bit harder at the setup but React made the final version of the project cleaner to build.

Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
