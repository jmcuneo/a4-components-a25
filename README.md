For this assignment, I decided to implement my Assignment 3, but using react. My major changes came in my server and client file. In the client file, I changed my functions to use states and manage those. I then also changed my server function to support React and moved my HTML. I still use Tailwinds for my CSS and Google Fonts.

I think the new technology hindered my experience slightly. I think coming from the previous structure we had used, it was definitely a bit to adjust to. Especially using Tailwinds, having everything in one file and running functions within the HTML made things quite bulky. However, I do see the positives to using React - I think being able to break things up into different components could be very helpful in segmenting pages and organizing things. I do just think the learning curve to using React was quite steep and I'm definitely still by no means fully comfortable.
