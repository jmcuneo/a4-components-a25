### Library Loan Tracker

Deployment: https://a4-kayliequach.onrender.com

The Library Loan Tracker is an application that allows users to add, modify, and delete library loan items in order to track their details and loan and due dates. For A4, what I changed was turning the simple JS client-side code into a React front-end using Vite. The handling for the submit/add, modify, and delete buttons are now also handled by React. 

I have worked with React before, and I think that React is really useful when handling the frontend for an extensive web applications with a large number of pages and more complex components. However, for a simple two-page application like mine here, using simple JS for client-side code vs. using React didn't have any benefits compared to each other. In this case, I think I would prefer using simple JS for all the component handling because it was difficult figuring out how to run the Express backend alongside the Vite-React frontend.
