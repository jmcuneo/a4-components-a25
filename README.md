## Car Database App

https://a4-ethancarter-a25-3.onrender.com

The website is meant for users to create a small car database that holds information like year released, model, and MPG. It also has a goofy derived price from MPG and year. This was an extention of A2, so no mongodb connection or login.

React for me hindered the development experience. Dealing with the client folder and running Vite to create the dist folder to run it all locally post-development was a hassle to set up correctly. Additionally, using React didn't get rid of
the need for HTML, it just combined the HTML file into the JSX file. I really appreciate the useState thing that I used in React because it made getting values easier than before, and the JSON that gets passed through in /submit or /modify
was made a lot easier to create. However, the code is basically the same from JS to JSX. I assume that's by design, and I can appreciate it, but getting the connection between Express and React was honestly a pain worth less than the benefits
React brought to the project.

### AI Usage

I used ChatGPT and Gemini for help with this project. I used the quick AI paragraph from Google searches from Gemini to help with quick debug issues. I used ChatGPT to help with React debugging and a bunch of Render issues I ran into.
