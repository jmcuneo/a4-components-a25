# Game Hub

Host Link: https://a4-tiennguyen.onrender.com

This project is for hosting whatever game my team has right now and in the future

I do this project totally from scratch using React and Style Component. In the game section, users can click on the game they like and it will lead them to a new tab with that game. Currently, I have not plug in any game yet but this is also used for the final project where all my team put the actual game in. 

For me, the new technology really improve the coding experience and make everything more fun. For example, style-component in React let me code mixing html and javascript at once.
