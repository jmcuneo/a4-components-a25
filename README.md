## Favorite Database

The project allows users to login in and add their favorite information to a database so they do not forget. Overall, I'd say the new technology hindered my experience. For my previous project, I used Handlebars for the login page. My React and Handlebars refused to get along so I eventually transfer the login page to be react as well. During the deployment process, I had issues with properly serving my dist folder. After some research, I found the * notation I was using was known to cause errors in Express 5, so I had to downgrade to Express 4 for it to work.

AI Usage: I used ChatGPT to help with bug fixing. This includes minor syntax error with refacotring my HTML to React and help with deployment bugs.
