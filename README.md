# Car Inventory Management System

**Live Application:** [Your Render Link Here]

A full-stack React application for managing car inventories with user authentication.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to create accounts and maintain a personal inventory of their vehicles. Each car entry includes model, year, MPG, with automatically calculated efficiency ratings and vehicle age.

### What's New
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Client-side state management using React hooks
- Dynamic updates without page refreshes
- Better code organization and separation of concerns

### Features
- User registration and login with automatic account creation
- Add, edit, and delete car entries
- Automatic efficiency classification and age calculation
- Responsive design for all devices

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React with functional components and hooks
- Custom CSS with themed color scheme
- Responsive design improvements

### Backend
- Express.js with RESTful API
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- express-session for session management

## Development Experience
- The React refactor at first took some time and did have complications.
After an adjustment period ended up allowing the project to be more
efficiently edited/debugged. Especially made styling easier when you
could focus on individual components more.

## Challenges
- Implementing secure session management with React
- State management across multiple components
