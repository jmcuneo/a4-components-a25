Summary of changes vs. starter code (A2):
- Replaced the Node server with Express and kept the same API routes.
- Migrated the frontend to Vite + React. The UI is now a single React component that renders the form and task table, with inline editing for name and time.
- Integrated ViteExpress so a single Node process serves the React app in development (via Vite) and the built client in production.


Did the new tech help?
- Learning React and Vite was a learning curve, as well as modifying my existing application to use them instead. Moreover, converting my HTML to JSX was a little difficult. However, React's ability to modify the UI in real time made debugging faster. So if I was buidling an application from scratch, I would prefer to use React and Vite for the frontend instead of traditional HTML + JS.
