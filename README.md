My project allows you to create checklists and add tasks. Completed tasks move to the completed section and you can rename and delete them.

I turned my project into a react project. I used components for the input to add new tasks, for each individual task item, for the list of tasks, and for the checklist sidebar. I also removed auth0, and instead added a login page that just takes a username and does no authentication.

The new technology killed me. This was a truly miserable experience. I have a lot of experience with react, but for whatever reason auth0 and deploying to various hosting sites was near impossible with a separate server and client to deploy. I had to simplify a lot to get it working. Had I started in react, and had more control over the frameworks I used and kept the server and frontend totally separate, I think I would have had less trouble.
