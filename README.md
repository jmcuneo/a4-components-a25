## Epic Expense Tracker

My project is an adaptation of my A2, a finance tracker that allows users to type in an expense name, cost, and category.
For this assignment, the only things I changed from A2 were the general look (I wanted a more spooky vibe), the abilities to edit the list, and adding React. In my opinion, adding react made this project much easier to make and handle. All of the updates are done live so you do not have to shut off and turn on the server to view most changes. It also autoloaded server side files so that I did not have to go through the difficult process of setting that up. Overall react made the assignment simpler. 

Changed:
- Background has shapes now -> I wanted to make a spider web background and this was as close as I could get without using an actual image
- I changed all of the coloration for the application
- Took feedback from last time to add the ability to edit table entries and reorder the list. 
- Separated the background from the actual applicaiton in an attempt to make it more visually appealing
