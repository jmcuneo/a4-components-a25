## WACCA Score Tracker

https://a4-ashleyfontaine-a25.onrender.com

This application is a score tracker for the arcade game WACCA, with a presistent database maintaining the scores. Most of the application is the same as my previous versions, but due to React's rendering capabilities, the user no longer has to manually load the new scores. Due to time constraints the banner image and loading data from the server is not available in this version.

The new technology did hinder my development greatly initially. I ran into a lot of issues with how React and specifically Vite handled the variables and functions I designed for my server in the pervious versions. However, I can see how building projects from the ground up with this technology would make it fast and much easier than project 3 was to build initially, rather than converting a project like that into React and Vite rather haphazardly.
