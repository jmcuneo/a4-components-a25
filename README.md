## Team To-Do List

My project is a team to-do list that is tailored for fraternities. The experience is very similar to my previous assignment which leads me to believe that developing a react applocation should be done from the beginning. Shifting to a new library for development may not allow the new library to be used to its potential if its features aren't kept in mind from the beginning of the development process.
