Hindered. I tried my best but I just can't let myself be delayed by this for any longer so this is unfortunately an incomplete submission. I tried so hard to figure out why it wasn't working, but it's saying it's logging in and it's registering the user being updated within the /login request but as soon it tries to redirect to another page or make another request it suddenly stops remembering that request.session.user exists. There's probably a really simple solution I'm missing but, again, I can't let this assignment delay me any longer so I just hope that the attempt at converting the pages shows effort.
